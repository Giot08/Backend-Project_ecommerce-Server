"""
A template made for start new proyects, the principal
idea is made a node backend template for quickstart 
my new proyects.

Probably i will add special features in branchs in future
of have the main branch as a core and other branch for 
target self template

This template is build with:
    ✔ Typescript
    ✔ Node js
    ✔ Express js
    ✔ PostgresSQL
